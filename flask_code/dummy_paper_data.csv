0,0.0,A note on denial-of-service in operating systems,A simple and general definition of denial-of-service in operating systems is presented. It is argued that no current protection mechanism nor model resolves this problem in any demonstrable way. The notion of interuser dependency is introduced and identified as the common cause for all problem instances. Decomposition of operating systems into hierarchies of services is assumed for the discovery of denial-of-service instances.,1984.0,Virgil D.

4,2.0,Deriving A Compiler From An Operational Semantics Written In Vdl,"This paper addresses the issue of compiler correctness. The approach taken is to systematically construct a correct compiler for a language from a formal semantic definition of the language. For this purpose, an operational semantics of a language is chosen as the basis for the approach. That is, the compiler for a language is derived from an interpreter of the language. The derivation process uses the notion of mixed computation proposed by Ershov. Briefly stated, one begins interpreting and when a primitive state changing instruction is about to be executed, the instruction is emitted as code instead. The correctness of all compilers produced by the method is guaranteed by proving the derivation rules correct. This proof is a one-time task for each specification language. The specification language studied in this paper is the Vienna Definition Language (VDL). The object code generated by the compiler is in an intermediate language close to an assembly language. Therefore, the translation from the intermediate language into the assembly language should be straightforward.",1985.0,S Mazaher,,"UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT COMP SCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024",105.0

6,3.0,Growing certainty with null values,"Non-availability of part of the data is a problem common to many database systems. We study here some aspects relating to incomplete information. Obviously, when the information in a database is not complete the answer to any query is only an approximation to the true result. The aim is to get a precise approximation. We regard databases as many-sorted algebras. Based on the concept of extended algebra we define what it means for an algebra to approximate another algebra. We then give the following simple principle for extending query languages to handle missing data: “Whenever information is added to an incomplete database subsequent answers to queries must not be contradictory or less informative than previously.” We then apply this principle to extend the functional query language Varqa. Finally, we compare the previously proposed many-valued logic systems with the system devised based on our principles.",1985.0,Forouzan Golshani,,"Department of Computer Science, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",189.0
7,4.0,Speed Of Response Using Keyboard And Screen-Based Microcomputer Response Media,"Response latencies were recorded during a continuous performance task using four standard microcomputer response media: the standard QWERTY keyboard, a numeric keypad, a light-pen and a touch-screen. There were significant differences among these media, the fastest responses being made with the touch-screen, and the slowest with the light-pen. The keypad was superior to the full keyboard. Within devices, the physical layout of the key-based devices accounted for the differences among responses with specific keys. A common pattern of response using the touch-screen and light-pen was found, with a constant offset of 309 ms for the light-pen. A tentative model of response execution with these screen-based devices is presented, with implications for the nature of response parameters in unconstrained response environments, and for the design of human-computer interfaces.",1985.0,Jg Beaumont,,"UNIV LEICESTER,DEPT PSYCHOL,LEICESTER LE1 7RH,ENGLAND",44.0
8,5.0,Accurate arithmetic results for decimal data on non-decimal computers.,"Recently, techniques have been devised and implemented which permit the computation of smallest enclosing machine number interval for the exact results of a good number of highly composite operations. These exact results refer, however, to the data as they are represented in the computer. This note shows how the conversion of decimal data into non-decimal representations may be joined with the mathematical operation on the data into one high-accuracy algorithm. Such an algorithm is explicitly presented for the solution of systems of linear equations.",1985.0,W. Auzinger,53f3217adabfae9a844587b9,"Technische Univ. Wien, Wien, Austria",241.0

15,8.0,An Interactive Fuzzy Decisionmaking Method Using Constraint Problems,"An interactive fuzzy decisionmaking method is presented, which assumes that the decisionmaker (DM) has fuzzy goals for each of the objective functions in multiobjective nonlinear programming problems. Having determined the membership functions for each of the objective functions, if the DM selects an appropriate standing membership function and specifies his/her aspiration levels of achievement of the other membership functions, called constraint membership values, the corresponding constraint problem is solved, and the DM is supplied with the Pareto optimal solution together with the trade-off rates between the membership functions. Then by considering the current values of the membership functions as well as the trade-off rates, the DM acts on this solution by updating his/her constraint membership values. In this way, the satisficing or compromise solution for the DM can be derived efficiently from among a Pareto optimal solution set. On the basis of the proposed method, a time-sharing computer program is written, and an illustrative numerical example is demonstrated along with the computer output.",1986.0,"Sakawa, M.",,"Department of Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe 657, Japan|c|",46.0
